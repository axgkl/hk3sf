I have this topology:

bastion node (pub ip, priv ip: 10.0.0.2)
master1, master2, master3 (10.0.0.3, 4, 5)

I can create an ingress and hetzner cloud controller will create the corresponding loadbalancer for my services.
Nice.
But now I would like to see if this could work with a traefik server on bastion as well, as gateway.
Important: bastion is not a member of the kubernetes cluster! Just a linux box with traefik binary installed!
But I want to use the gateway api of kubernetes, so that a gateway controller can use that traefik to configure routes on it.

Is this possible? My kubernetes is the newest version.

  Copilot ───

Yes, it is possible to use an external Traefik instance as a gateway for your Kubernetes services, but it requires manual configuration and is not managed by Kubernetes. 

The Gateway API is a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) that provides a way to describe network gateways in a Kubernetes-native way. However, the Gateway API is designed to work with ingress controllers running inside the Kubernetes cluster, not with external gateways.

To use an external Traefik instance as a gateway, you would need to manually configure Traefik to route traffic to your Kubernetes services. This would involve configuring Traefik backends to point to the internal IP addresses of your services, and configuring frontends to route traffic to these backends based on the host or path.

Here is an example of how you might configure a Traefik backend and frontend to route traffic to a Kubernetes service:

```toml
[backends]
  [backends.backend1]
    [backends.backend1.servers.server1]
    url = "http://10.0.0.3:8080"

[frontends]
  [frontends.frontend1]
  backend = "backend1"
  [frontends.frontend1.routes.test_1]
  rule = "Host:test.localhost"
```

In this example, `backend1` is configured to route traffic to a service running on `10.0.0.3:8080`, and `frontend1` is configured to route traffic from `test.localhost` to `backend1`.

However, this setup has some limitations. Since the Traefik instance is not managed by Kubernetes, it won't automatically update its configuration when services are added, removed, or changed in the Kubernetes cluster. You would need to manually update the Traefik configuration each time you make a change to your services.

  Gk ───

And if I use traefik in the same way than the hetzner loadbalancer? That one has tcp forwarding rules set, to all cluster nodes in the internal network. Couldn't traefik just do that as well?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can configure Traefik to perform TCP forwarding similar to how a load balancer would. Traefik supports TCP routing in addition to HTTP routing, which allows it to forward TCP traffic to your Kubernetes nodes.

Here is an example of how you might configure Traefik to forward TCP traffic to your Kubernetes nodes:

```toml
[tcp]
  [tcp.routers]
    [tcp.routers.to-master1]
      rule = "HostSNI(`*`)"
      service = "master1"
      entrypoints = ["web"]

  [tcp.services]
    [tcp.services.master1]
      [tcp.services.master1.loadBalancer]
        [[tcp.services.master1.loadBalancer.servers]]
          address = "10.0.0.3:8080"
```

In this example, the `to-master1` TCP router is configured to route all TCP traffic (`HostSNI(`*`)`) received on the `web` entrypoint to the `master1` service. The `master1` service is a TCP load balancer that forwards traffic to `10.0.0.3:8080`.

You would need to repeat this configuration for each of your Kubernetes nodes, changing the service name and address as appropriate.

However, keep in mind that this setup still has the same limitations as before. Since the Traefik instance is not managed by Kubernetes, it won't automatically update its configuration when nodes are added, removed, or changed in the Kubernetes cluster. You would need to manually update the Traefik configuration each time you make a change to your nodes.

Isn't there something like the hetzner could controller, which talks to the hetzner api to create and configure loadbalancers, for a normal linux box, with ssh access ?

  Copilot ───

There isn't a direct equivalent to the Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager for a standalone Linux box. The Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager is a Kubernetes add-on that integrates the Kubernetes cluster with the Hetzner Cloud API, allowing Kubernetes to automatically manage and configure Hetzner Cloud Load Balancers.

For a standalone Linux box, you would typically use a configuration management tool or a script to automate the configuration of services like Traefik. Tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or even a simple Bash script can be used to automate the installation and configuration of software on a Linux box.

For example, you could write an Ansible playbook that installs Traefik, configures it to forward traffic to your Kubernetes nodes, and updates the configuration whenever the list of nodes changes. This would require some knowledge of Ansible and the ability to write a playbook, but it would give you a lot of flexibility in how you manage your Traefik instance.

However, this approach still requires manual intervention to update the configuration when the list of Kubernetes nodes changes. It doesn't provide the same level of automation and integration with Kubernetes that you get with the Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager.

  Gk ───

So there is no single tool which looks like an infrastructure specific loadbalancer manager, which configures a normal linux box to act like a loadbalancer?

  Copilot ───

There isn't a single tool that specifically configures a standalone Linux box to act as a load balancer for a Kubernetes cluster in the same way that cloud-specific controllers do. 

Cloud-specific controllers like the Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager are designed to work within the context of a specific cloud provider's infrastructure and APIs, and they are tightly integrated with Kubernetes. They automatically react to changes in the Kubernetes cluster and update the cloud provider's load balancer configuration accordingly.

For a standalone Linux box, you would typically use a combination of tools and services to achieve a similar result. For example, you might use:

- A load balancer software like Traefik, HAProxy, or Nginx to distribute traffic to your Kubernetes nodes.
- A configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the installation and configuration of the load balancer software.
- A monitoring tool like Prometheus or Nagios to monitor the health of your nodes and services.
- A scripting language like Bash or Python to automate tasks like updating the load balancer configuration when the list of nodes changes.

While this approach requires more setup and maintenance than using a cloud-specific controller, it gives you more flexibility and control over your infrastructure. You can customize the load balancer configuration to suit your specific needs, and you can use the tools and services that you are most comfortable with.

  Gk ───

Doesnt' traefik have an api, to configure it on the fly, and a corresponding gateway controller, which uses that api to set rules?

  Copilot ───

Yes, Traefik does indeed have an API that allows you to configure it on the fly. This API can be used to dynamically update the routing rules and backends without needing to restart Traefik.

However, as of now, there isn't a built-in Kubernetes Gateway controller specifically for Traefik that would automatically configure an external Traefik instance via this API based on Gateway API resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

The Traefik Kubernetes Ingress controller can dynamically update the routing configuration based on Ingress resources in the cluster, but this requires Traefik to be running inside the Kubernetes cluster as a pod, not as an external standalone instance.

If you want to use an external Traefik instance as a gateway for your Kubernetes services and have it automatically update its configuration based on changes in the cluster, you would need to build a custom controller or script that watches the Kubernetes API for changes and updates the Traefik configuration via its API accordingly. This would require a good understanding of both the Kubernetes API and the Traefik API, and it would likely be a non-trivial amount of work.

  Gk ───

So would you recommand to add my bastion node to the cluster, i.e. with a k3s agent? Would then all work?

  Copilot ───

Adding your bastion node to the Kubernetes cluster as a worker node (using a k3s agent) could indeed simplify the setup. Once the bastion node is part of the cluster, you can run Traefik as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller on it. 

In this setup, Traefik would automatically update its configuration based on Ingress resources in the cluster. This means that when you create, update, or delete Kubernetes services, Traefik would automatically reflect these changes in its routing configuration.

Here are the steps you would need to follow:

1. Install the k3s agent on the bastion node and join it to the cluster.
2. Deploy Traefik to the cluster, making sure it's scheduled to run on the bastion node. You can do this by using a nodeSelector in your Traefik deployment configuration.
3. Create Ingress resources for your services. These Ingress resources define the rules for routing external traffic to your services.

However, keep in mind that adding a bastion node to your cluster might have security implications. Bastion nodes are typically used as secure, tightly controlled access points to your network. By adding it to your Kubernetes cluster, you're potentially exposing it to additional risks. Make sure to properly secure the node and the Kubernetes components running on it.

  Gk ───

Ok, detail step 1.

  Copilot ───

To add your bastion node to the Kubernetes cluster as a worker node using k3s, you'll need to install the k3s agent on the bastion node and join it to the cluster. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Get the k3s installation script**: You can download the k3s installation script from the k3s GitHub repository using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io -o install-k3s.sh
    ```

2. **Get the k3s server node-token from one of your master nodes**: The node-token is required to join the worker node to the cluster. You can get it from one of your master nodes with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
    ```

    This will output a string that looks something like this: `K1040c2b24b8a945379a1a7b8a87f0e1c17dfdc2c71f8b6538e2bb5c8a0c9c::node:7e4a0ee46bff6a7a4b6b7c5df7`

3. **Install the k3s agent on the bastion node**: Run the k3s installation script on the bastion node with the `K3S_URL` and `K3S_TOKEN` environment variables set to the URL of one of your master nodes and the node-token you got in the previous step:

    ```bash
    sudo K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken sh install-k3s.sh
    ```

    Replace `https://myserver:6443` with the URL of one of your master nodes and `mynodetoken` with the node-token.

After running these steps, the k3s agent should be installed on the bastion node and it should join the cluster as a worker node. You can verify this by running `kubectl get nodes` on one of your master nodes. You should see the bastion node listed as a worker node.

  Gk ───

My k3s installer did set a lot of config vars for k3s. Where can I find them on the existing server? does it make sense to 'steal' that config from an existing node?

  Copilot ───

The configuration for the k3s server or agent is typically stored in a systemd service file if you installed k3s using the installation script. You can view this file using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl cat k3s
```

or for the agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl cat k3s-agent
```

This will display the contents of the service file, which includes the command used to start the k3s server or agent. This command includes any configuration options that were set during installation.

It can make sense to use the same configuration options when adding a new node to the cluster, especially if you have a specific configuration that you want all nodes to share. However, be careful with options that should be unique per node, such as the node name.

Also, remember that the token and the URL of the server will be different when you're setting up an agent compared to a server. The token should be the one from the server and the URL should point to the server.

  Gk ───

Is there a general recipe for manually adding new k3s agent nodes to the cluster?

  Copilot ───

Yes, there is a general recipe for manually adding new k3s agent nodes to a k3s cluster. Here are the steps:

1. **Obtain the k3s server's node-token**: On the k3s server, run the following command to get the node-token:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
    ```

    This will output a string that is used to authenticate the new node to the cluster.

2. **Install k3s on the new node**: On the new node, use the k3s installation script to install k3s and join the node to the cluster. Set the `K3S_URL` environment variable to the URL of your k3s server (replace `https://myserver:6443` with your k3s server's URL) and the `K3S_TOKEN` environment variable to the node-token you obtained in the previous step:

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken sh -
    ```

3. **Verify the new node has joined the cluster**: On the k3s server, run the following command to list all nodes in the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    You should see the new node listed as a worker node.

Remember to replace `https://myserver:6443` with the URL of your k3s server and `mynodetoken` with the node-token. The URL should be reachable from the new node and the port (default is 6443) should be open in your firewall.

This process can be repeated for each new node you want to add to the cluster.

  Gk ───

An existing agent node has this in k3s-agent.service:

        '--node-external-ip=95.217.131.165' \
        '--flannel-iface=enp7s0' \


Question: When I install like you said, will this be set correctly? Like node ip? And node-external-ip?

  Copilot ───

The `k3s agent` command you've shown includes several arguments that are specific to the node it's running on. These arguments won't be set automatically when you install k3s on a new node using the installation script. You'll need to provide them manually.

Here's what each argument does:

- `--node-name`: Sets the name of the node. This should be unique for each node in the cluster.
- `--kubelet-arg=cloud-provider=external`: Tells the kubelet that the cloud provider is external. This is typically used when you're using a cloud controller manager.
- `--node-ip`: Sets the internal IP address of the node.
- `--node-external-ip`: Sets the external IP address of the node.
- `--flannel-iface`: Specifies the network interface that Flannel should use for networking.

When you install k3s on a new node, you'll need to provide these arguments with values that are appropriate for the new node. You can do this by adding them to the `INSTALL_K3S_EXEC` environment variable when you run the installation script. Here's an example:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent --node-name=mynewnode --kubelet-arg=cloud-provider=external --node-ip=10.0.0.8 --node-external-ip=95.217.131.166 --flannel-iface=enp7s0" sh -
```

Replace `mynewnode`, `10.0.0.8`, and `95.217.131.166` with the name and IP addresses of your new node, and `enp7s0` with the appropriate network interface.

  Gk ───

what about the k3s version?

  Copilot ───

The k3s installation script installs the latest stable release of k3s by default. If you want to install a specific version of k3s, you can do so by setting the `INSTALL_K3S_VERSION` environment variable when you run the installation script.

Here's an example of how to install a specific version of k3s:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.21.5+k3s2 K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent --node-name=mynewnode --kubelet-arg=cloud-provider=external --node-ip=10.0.0.8 --node-external-ip=95.217.131.166 --flannel-iface=enp7s0" sh -
```

Replace `v1.21.5+k3s2` with the version of k3s you want to install.

It's generally a good idea to use the same version of k3s on all nodes in your cluster. You can check the version of k3s on an existing node by running the following command:

```bash
k3s --version
```

This will output the version of k3s that is currently installed on the node.

anything else you forgot to tell me? Think hard, I want the new node be a normal member of hte cluster, like all the other agents...  Access to secrets, hetzner csi interface...

  Copilot ───

The steps provided should be sufficient to add a new node to the cluster and have it function as a normal worker node. However, there are a few additional considerations:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: If your cluster uses RBAC, you'll need to ensure that the new node has the necessary permissions to access Kubernetes resources. This is typically handled automatically when the node joins the cluster, but you may need to update your RBAC policies if you have custom configurations.

- **Hetzner CSI**: If you're using the Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager and the Hetzner CSI driver for volume provisioning, these should continue to work as expected when you add a new node. The CSI driver will be able to provision and attach volumes to pods running on the new node. However, you should verify that the necessary CSI components are running and healthy after adding the new node.

- **Network Policies**: If you're using network policies to control traffic between pods, you'll need to ensure that these policies allow traffic to and from pods on the new node.

- **Taints and Tolerations**: If you're using taints and tolerations to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes, you'll need to apply the appropriate taints to the new node and ensure that your pods have the necessary tolerations.

- **Node Labels and Selectors**: If you're using node labels and selectors to control pod scheduling, you'll need to apply the appropriate labels to the new node.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: If you're using a monitoring and logging solution, you'll need to ensure that it's configured to collect metrics and logs from the new node.

Remember to verify the status and functionality of the new node after it joins the cluster. You can use `kubectl get nodes` to check the node's status, and `kubectl describe node <node-name>` to get more detailed information. You should also monitor the logs of your applications and system components to ensure they're functioning correctly on the new node.

  Gk ───

I would like to easily exclude that node for any service pod. How is that done?

  Copilot ───

You can prevent service pods from being scheduled on a specific node by using Kubernetes taints and tolerations.

A taint is a marker you can apply to a node that tells the Kubernetes scheduler to avoid scheduling certain pods on it. A toleration is a property you can apply to a pod that allows it to be scheduled on a node with a specific taint.

Here's how you can apply a taint to your node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node, and `key=value` with a key-value pair of your choosing. The `NoSchedule` effect means that no new pods will be scheduled onto the node unless they have a matching toleration.

Once you've applied the taint, any new pods that don't have a matching toleration will not be scheduled on the node. Existing pods on the node will not be affected.

If you want to add a toleration to a pod so that it can be scheduled on the node, you can do so in the pod's spec:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Replace `key` and `value` with the key-value pair you used when you applied the taint. This toleration will allow the pod to be scheduled on the node despite the taint.

Remember that taints and tolerations are just one part of the Kubernetes scheduling process. The scheduler also takes into account other factors like resource requirements, node affinity/anti-affinity, and node conditions.

  Gk ───

so i can do that AFTER i added taht node to the cluster?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can apply a taint to a node at any time, whether it's before or after you add the node to the cluster. 

When you apply a taint to a node, it affects the scheduling of future pods. Existing pods on the node are not affected unless the taint's effect is `NoExecute`, in which case they are evicted.

Here's the command to apply a taint to a node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node, and `key=value` with a key-value pair of your choosing. The `NoSchedule` effect means that no new pods will be scheduled onto the node unless they have a matching toleration.

After you've added the node to the cluster, you can apply the taint to prevent new pods from being scheduled on it. If you want to allow certain pods to be scheduled on the node, you can add a matching toleration to their specs.

  Gk ───

can i set roles of that node after creation?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can assign roles to a node after it has been added to the cluster. In Kubernetes, roles are represented as labels on the node. 

The standard node roles in Kubernetes are `master` and `worker`, represented by the labels `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker` respectively. However, you can create custom roles by applying custom labels.

Here's how you can add a role to a node:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>=
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node, and `<role>` with the role you want to assign. The `=` at the end is necessary and indicates that you're assigning the label.

For example, to assign the `worker` role to a node, you would run:

```bash
kubectl label nodes mynode node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
```

To remove a role from a node, you can use the `kubectl label` command with the `-` option:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>-
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node, and `<role>` with the role you want to remove.

Remember that roles in Kubernetes are primarily a way of organizing nodes and don't have any inherent meaning. The effect of a role depends on how you use it in your configurations. For example, you might use node selectors in your pod specs to control which roles a pod can be scheduled on.

  Gk ───

All right, bastion is added to the cluster, as an agent node.

  Copilot ───

Great! Now that your bastion node is part of the Kubernetes cluster, you can use it like any other worker node in the cluster. 

Remember to monitor the node and ensure it's functioning correctly. You can use `kubectl get nodes` to check the status of the node, and `kubectl describe node <node-name>` to get more detailed information.

If you want to prevent certain pods from being scheduled on the bastion node, remember to use taints and tolerations as discussed earlier. 

Now you can proceed with deploying Traefik or any other workloads on the node as needed. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

  Gk ───

how see which pods are on a node?

  Copilot ───

You can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to see which pods are running on a specific node. The `get pods` command has a `-o jsonpath` option that you can use to filter the output based on the node name.

Here's an example:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{range .items[?(@.spec.nodeName=='<node-name>')]}{.metadata.name}{'\t'}{.metadata.namespace}{'\n'}{end}"
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node. This command will output a list of all pods running on the specified node, along with the namespace of each pod.

This command works by getting a list of all pods (`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`), then filtering the output based on the node name (`-o jsonpath="{range .items[?(@.spec.nodeName=='<node-name>')]}{.metadata.name}{'\t'}{.metadata.namespace}{'\n'}{end}"`). The `{range .items[?(@.spec.nodeName=='<node-name>')]}...{end}` part is a jsonpath expression that selects all items where the `spec.nodeName` field equals the specified node name.

Failed to get nodegroup for bastion: failed to check if server  exists error: failed to get servers for node bastion error: server not found
I see that in the cluster-autoscaler logs.

  Copilot ───

The error message suggests that the cluster-autoscaler is trying to find a node group for the "bastion" node but is unable to find it. 

The cluster-autoscaler works with node groups, which are typically groups of nodes managed by a cloud provider's autoscaling service (like AWS Auto Scaling groups, GCP Managed Instance groups, or Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets). In the context of k3s, node groups might not be applicable if you're not using a cloud provider's autoscaling service.

If your "bastion" node is a standalone node that you've added manually, it might not be part of a node group. This could be why the cluster-autoscaler is unable to find a node group for it.

If you're not using a cloud provider's autoscaling service and you don't need the cluster-autoscaler to manage the "bastion" node, you can ignore this error. The cluster-autoscaler should continue to function normally for any node groups that it can find.

If you do want the cluster-autoscaler to manage the "bastion" node, you'll need to ensure that the node is part of a node group. The process for doing this depends on your cloud provider and your cluster configuration.

anyway: I would like to continue with the traefik topic now. I see that k3s installs with traefik, correct?

  Copilot ───

Yes, by default, k3s includes Traefik as an ingress controller. It's installed as a Helm chart and runs as a deployment in the `kube-system` namespace.

You can verify if Traefik is running by executing the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

In the output, you should see a pod with a name that starts with `traefik-`.

If you want to customize the Traefik installation, you can modify the Traefik Helm chart values. The chart values are stored in a ConfigMap named `traefik`, also in the `kube-system` namespace.

Keep in mind that if you want to use a different version of Traefik or install it in a different way, you can disable the default Traefik installation when you install k3s by adding the `--no-deploy traefik` option.

  Gk ───

can I deploy traefik just the same AFTER the cluster is up, when i disabled it at install time?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can deploy Traefik after the cluster is up even if you disabled it during the k3s installation. 

You can deploy Traefik as a Helm chart, or you can use a Kubernetes manifest file. Here's a basic example of how to deploy Traefik using Helm:

1. **Add the Traefik Helm repository**:

    ```bash
    helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
    ```

2. **Update your Helm repository list**:

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

3. **Install the Traefik Helm chart**:

    ```bash
    helm install traefik traefik/traefik
    ```

This will install Traefik with the default configuration. If you want to customize the configuration, you can create a values file and pass it to the `helm install` command with the `-f` option.

Remember to replace `traefik` with the name you want to give to your Traefik Helm release. This name is used by Helm to identify the release.

After you've installed Traefik, you can verify that it's running by checking the list of pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see a pod with a name that starts with the name of your Traefik Helm release.

Yes, it's possible to install Traefik on your 'bastion' node and use it as a load balancer for your Kubernetes services. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Taint the 'bastion' node**: To ensure that only the Traefik pod gets scheduled on the 'bastion' node, you can apply a taint to the node:

    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes bastion key=value:NoSchedule
    ```

2. **Create a toleration for the Traefik pod**: To allow the Traefik pod to be scheduled on the 'bastion' node despite the taint, you can add a toleration to the Traefik Helm chart values. Create a values file (e.g., `values.yaml`) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    deployment:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```

3. **Create a nodeSelector for the Traefik pod**: To ensure that the Traefik pod gets scheduled on the 'bastion' node, you can add a nodeSelector to the Traefik Helm chart values. Add the following to your values file:

    ```yaml
    deployment:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: bastion
    ```

4. **Install the Traefik Helm chart**: Install the Traefik Helm chart using the values file:

    ```bash
    helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f values.yaml
    ```

This will install Traefik on the 'bastion' node and configure it to act as a load balancer for your Kubernetes services. Traefik will automatically update its configuration based on Ingress resources in the cluster, so you can control the routing of traffic by creating and updating Ingress resources.

Remember to replace `key=value` with the key-value pair you used when you applied the taint, and `bastion` with the name of your 'bastion' node.

I have a node which I manually put into an existing k3s cluster, as agent. That cluster I deleted. How to uninstall k3s from that node?

  Copilot ───

To uninstall k3s from a node, you can use the uninstallation script provided by k3s. This script is installed along with k3s and is located at `/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh` for a server, and `/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh` for an agent.

Since your node was added as an agent, you can run the following command to uninstall k3s:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh
```

This script will stop the k3s agent service and remove all components installed by k3s, including the binary, the systemd service definitions, and various files and directories used by k3s.

After running this script, k3s should be completely removed from your node.

How to check the hostname?

  Copilot ───

You can check the hostname of your Linux machine by using the `hostname` command in the terminal:

```bash
hostname
```

This command will output the current hostname of your machine. The hostname is the name that the system is known by to other machines on the network.

If you want to see the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), you can use the `-f` option:

```bash
hostname -f
```

This command will output the full domain name of your machine, which includes the hostname and the domain name.

  Gk ───

No, i mean the hostname which k8s uses for node selectors.

  Copilot ───

The hostname that Kubernetes uses for node selectors is the name of the Node resource in Kubernetes, which by default is the same as the hostname of the machine. 

You can check the Kubernetes node name by using the `kubectl get nodes` command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

This command will output a list of all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. The NAME column shows the name of each node, which is the name you can use in node selectors.

If you want to see more detailed information about a node, including all its labels, you can use the `kubectl describe node <node-name>` command:

```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node. This command will output detailed information about the node, including its labels, which you can use in node selectors.

can I install traefik with this? show me how.

  Copilot ───

Your values file currently has two `deployment` keys, which is not valid YAML. You should combine them into one `deployment` key like this:

```yaml
deployment:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: bastion
```

This configuration will schedule the Traefik deployment on the node with the hostname `bastion` and it will tolerate the taint with key `key` and value `value`.

Now, you can install Traefik using Helm with this values file:

1. **Add the Traefik Helm repository**:

    ```bash
    helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
    ```

2. **Update your Helm repository list**:

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

3. **Install the Traefik Helm chart**:

    ```bash
    helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f values.yaml
    ```

This command will install Traefik with the configuration specified in your `values.yaml` file. The `-f values.yaml` option tells Helm to use the values in the `values.yaml` file to override the default values of the Traefik Helm chart.

After running these commands, Traefik should be installed on your `bastion` node. You can verify this by checking the list of pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see a pod with a name that starts with `traefik-`.

  Gk ───

deployment:

  Copilot ───

Yes, that's correct. This configuration will schedule the Traefik deployment on the node with the hostname `bastion` and it will tolerate the taint with key `key` and value `value`.

Now, you can install Traefik using Helm with this values file:

1. **Add the Traefik Helm repository**:

    ```bash

    ```

3. **Install the Traefik Helm chart**:

    ```bash
    helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f values.yaml
    ```

This command will install Traefik with the configuration specified in your `values.yaml` file. The `-f values.yaml` option tells Helm to use the values in the `values.yaml` file to override the default values of the Traefik Helm chart.

After running these commands, Traefik should be installed on your `bastion` node. You can verify this by checking the list of pods:

How to force installation on a specific node, via helm?

  Copilot ───

To force the installation of a Helm chart on a specific node, you can use a nodeSelector in your Helm values file. The nodeSelector is a field in the pod spec that specifies a set of labels that must be present on a node for a pod to be scheduled on that node.

In your values file, you can specify the nodeSelector under the appropriate key for the deployment. For example, if you're installing Traefik, you would specify it under the `deployment` key:

```yaml
deployment:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: <node-name>
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node where you want to install the Helm chart. This configuration will schedule the pods of the Helm chart on the specified node.

Then, when you install the Helm chart, use the `-f` option to specify your values file:

```bash
helm install <release-name> <chart> -f values.yaml
```

Replace `<release-name>` with the name you want to give to your Helm release, and `<chart>` with the name of the Helm chart you're installing.

This command will install the Helm chart with the configuration specified in your `values.yaml` file, which includes the nodeSelector that schedules the pods on the specified node.

Will this be deployed to the agent node with unix hostname 'bast' and k3s nodename 'bastion' ?

  Copilot ───

The `nodeSelector` field in your Kubernetes Deployment is currently set to select nodes with the label `kubernetes.io/hostname: bast`. This means that Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the pods on a node where the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label is `bast`.

In a standard Kubernetes setup, the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label is automatically set to the hostname of the node. So if the hostname of your node in the Unix system is `bast`, then this Deployment should be scheduled on that node.

However, you mentioned that the k3s node name is `bastion`. If `bastion` is the name that appears when you run `kubectl get nodes`, and `bast` is not listed, then this Deployment will not be scheduled because there is no node with the label `kubernetes.io/hostname: bast`.

To ensure that the Deployment is scheduled on the correct node, you should set the `nodeSelector` to match the actual label of the node. If the node name in k3s is `bastion`, then you should use `kubernetes.io/hostname: bastion` in your `nodeSelector`.

  Gk ───

both version remain pending

  Copilot ───

If your pods remain in the `Pending` state, it means that Kubernetes is not able to schedule them on any node. There could be several reasons for this:

1. **Taints and Tolerations**: The node might have a taint that the pod does not tolerate. You can check the taints on the node with `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.

2. **Insufficient Resources**: The node might not have enough resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run the pod. You can check the resource usage on the node with `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.

3. **NodeSelector**: The pod's NodeSelector might not match any nodes. Make sure that the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label on the node matches the value in the pod's NodeSelector.

4. **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity**: The pod might have affinity/anti-affinity rules that prevent it from being scheduled on the node.

5. **Other Scheduling Constraints**: The pod might have other scheduling constraints that prevent it from being scheduled on the node.

To diagnose the issue, you can describe the pod to see the events and conditions associated with it:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of your pod. Look at the `Events` section at the bottom of the output to see if there are any messages that might indicate why the pod is not being scheduled.

If you're still unable to determine why the pod is not being scheduled, you can look at the logs of the Kubernetes scheduler for more information:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l component=kube-scheduler
```

This command will output the logs of the Kubernetes scheduler, which might include more detailed information about why the pod is not being scheduled.

From the output of `kubectl describe node bastion`, it appears that your node `bastion` has two taints:

```bash
Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
                    node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable:NoSchedule
```

The `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule` taint is typically added by Kubernetes when a node is first created, and it is removed once the cloud provider successfully initializes the node. 

The `node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable:NoSchedule` taint is added by Kubernetes when the network plugin reports that the network is not ready, and it is removed when the network becomes ready.

These taints prevent pods that do not tolerate them from being scheduled on the node. 

If your pods remain in the `Pending` state, it could be because they do not tolerate these taints. You can add tolerations for these taints to your pods' specs to allow them to be scheduled on the node.

Here's how you can add the tolerations to your Helm values file:

```yaml
deployment:
  tolerations:
  - key: "node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: bastion
```

This configuration will tolerate both the `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule` and `node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable:NoSchedule` taints, allowing the pods to be scheduled on the node even if it is not fully initialized or the network is not ready.

  Gk ───

So these are not optimal: 

Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
                    node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable:NoSchedule

                    ?

  Copilot ───

Correct, these taints can prevent certain pods from being scheduled on the node.

The `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule` taint is typically added by Kubernetes when a node is first created, and it is removed once the cloud provider successfully initializes the node. 

The `node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable:NoSchedule` taint is added by Kubernetes when the network plugin reports that the network is not ready, and it is removed when the network becomes ready.

If these taints are present on a node, it means that the node is not fully ready to accept pods. This could be because the cloud provider has not fully initialized the node, or because the network is not ready.

If you're trying to schedule a pod on a node with these taints, and the pod does not tolerate the taints, the pod will not be scheduled on the node. To allow the pod to be scheduled on the node, you can add tolerations for these taints to the pod's spec.

copilot chat runs in neovim, in something like split pane. Possible to run in ful window?

  Copilot ───

Yes, it's possible to run the chat in a full window in Neovim. Neovim allows you to manage your workspace with split windows, tabs, and buffers. 

If you have a split window and you want to make the current window take up the full screen, you can use the `:only` command:

```bash
:only
```

This command will close all other windows in the current tab and leave only the current window open.

If you want to go back to the previous window layout, you can use the `:undo` command:

```bash
:undo
```

This command will undo the last change to the window layout, which in this case was the `:only` command.

Remember that these commands only affect the current tab. If you have other tabs open, they will not be affected.

How could I get rid of this taint here on a hetzner agent node?

node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule

  Copilot ───

The `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule` taint is typically added by Kubernetes when a node is first created, and it is removed once the cloud provider successfully initializes the node.

If the taint is not being removed automatically, it could be because the cloud provider is not fully initializing the node for some reason. You might want to check the logs of the cloud controller manager to see if there are any errors.

However, if you're sure that the node is properly initialized and you want to manually remove the taint, you can do so with the `kubectl taint node` command:

```bash
kubectl taint node <node-name> node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule-
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your node. The `-` at the end of the taint key-value pair indicates that you want to remove the taint.

After running this command, the taint should be removed from the node. You can verify this by describing the node with `kubectl describe node <node-name>`. The taint should no longer be listed in the Taints section of the output.

  Copilot ───

The error message suggests that the cloud controller manager (CCM) is trying to create a route for the node `bastion` but is unable to find the node in the Hetzner Cloud servers cache.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **The node is not recognized by the Hetzner Cloud API**: The CCM uses the Hetzner Cloud API to manage resources. If the node was not created through the Hetzner Cloud API (for example, if it was created manually or through a different API), the CCM might not be able to recognize it.

2. **The node name does not match the server name in Hetzner Cloud**: The CCM uses the node name to identify the corresponding server in Hetzner Cloud. If the node name in Kubernetes does not match the server name in Hetzner Cloud, the CCM will not be able to find the server.

3. **There is a delay or error in updating the servers cache**: The CCM maintains a cache of the servers in Hetzner Cloud. If there is a delay or error in updating this cache, the CCM might not have the latest information about the servers.

To resolve this issue, you could try the following:

- Verify that the node `bastion` exists in Hetzner Cloud and that its server name matches the node name in Kubernetes.
- Check the logs of the CCM for any errors or delays in updating the servers cache.
- If the node was not created through the Hetzner Cloud API, consider recreating it through the API so that it is recognized by the CCM.
- If all else fails, you might consider reaching out to Hetzner Cloud support for assistance.

Can those 3 lines reduced to one, setting the token variable?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can use SSH to execute the `cat` command remotely and assign the output to the `token` variable in one line:

```bash
token=$(ssh m1 "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token")
```

This command will SSH into `m1`, run the `cat` command to get the content of the node-token file, and assign the output to the `token` variable on your local machine.

Note that you might need to use `sudo` to read the node-token file, depending on the permissions of the file.

  Gk ───

if ssh fails, what then?

  Copilot ───

If the SSH command fails, the `token` variable will not be set and the command will return a non-zero exit status. 

You can handle this in your script by checking the exit status of the command using the special variable `$?`, which holds the exit status of the last command that was executed. Here's an example:

```bash
token=$(ssh m1 "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token") || { echo "SSH command failed with exit status $?"; exit 1; }
```

In this example, if the SSH command fails, the script will print an error message and exit with a non-zero status.

The SSH command might fail for several reasons, such as network issues, incorrect SSH configuration, or permission issues on the remote server. The error message from SSH should give you some indication of what went wrong.

  Gk ───

when the ssh needs user input? will that work?

  Copilot ───

If the SSH command requires user input, such as entering a password, it will still work in the command substitution `$(...)`. The SSH command will wait for user input before continuing.

However, if you're running this command in a script and you want it to run unattended, you'll need to set up a way for SSH to authenticate without requiring user input. The most common way to do this is by using SSH keys:

1. Generate an SSH key pair on the local machine (if you haven't already done so) with the `ssh-keygen` command.
2. Copy the public key to the remote machine with the `ssh-copy-id` command.
3. Make sure the remote machine allows key-based authentication. This is usually controlled by the `PasswordAuthentication` and `PubkeyAuthentication` options in the SSH daemon configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).

Once you've set up key-based authentication, the SSH command should be able to authenticate without requiring user input, allowing your script to run unattended.

ip=$(cat ippub)
rm ippub

  Copilot ───

You can combine these lines into one by using command substitution `$(...)` to directly assign the output of the commands to the `ip` variable:

```bash
ip=$(ssh broot ifconfig | grep -A 2 eth0 | grep inet | xargs | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
```

This command will SSH into `broot`, run `ifconfig`, filter the output to get the IP address, and assign the IP address to the `ip` variable. 

This eliminates the need to write the IP address to a temporary file and then read it back into the variable, which makes the command more efficient and avoids leaving temporary files behind.

for caddy the helm value ingressController.config.email 	string 	""  is given in their docs. How to put that into a values.yaml ?

  Copilot ───

To set the `ingressController.config.email` value in a `values.yaml` file for the Caddy Helm chart, you can use the following YAML syntax:

```yaml
ingressController:
  config:
    email: "your-email@example.com"
```

Replace `"your-email@example.com"` with your actual email address. This `values.yaml` file sets the `email` field under `ingressController.config`.

When you install or upgrade the Caddy Helm chart, you can use the `-f` option with the `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command to specify your `values.yaml` file:

```bash
helm install my-caddy caddy/caddy -f values.yaml
```

This command installs the Caddy Helm chart with the release name `my-caddy`, using the configuration specified in your `values.yaml` file.

  Copilot ───

The YAML you've posted is indeed invalid due to incorrect indentation. In YAML, indentation is used to denote structure. The properties `onDemandRateLimitInterval` and `onDemandRateLimitBurst` are indented more than `onDemandTLS`, which would imply they are sub-properties of `onDemandTLS`, but that's not correct according to the structure you've shown.

Here's the correct way to set these properties:

```yaml
onDemandTLS: true
onDemandRateLimitInterval: 10
onDemandRateLimitBurst: 100
```

In this corrected YAML, `onDemandTLS`, `onDemandRateLimitInterval`, and `onDemandRateLimitBurst` are all at the same level of indentation, indicating they are properties of the same object.

  Copilot ───

The `EXTERNAL-IP` field in the output of `kubectl get svc -n caddy-system` shows the external IP address that is assigned to the LoadBalancer service by the cloud provider. If the `EXTERNAL-IP` is `<pending>`, it means that the cloud provider has not yet assigned an external IP address to the LoadBalancer.

However, in your case, since you're running the Caddy ingress controller on a specific node (the `bast` node) and not using a cloud provider's load balancer, the LoadBalancer service won't get an external IP address assigned by a cloud provider. Instead, you should use the external IP address of the `bast` node (`95.217.1.185` according to the output of `kubectl get nodes -o wide`) to access the Caddy ingress controller.

The LoadBalancer service type is typically used when you're running your cluster in a cloud provider environment that supports automatic creation of load balancers and assignment of external IP addresses. If you're not using such an environment, you might want to use a different service type, such as NodePort or ExternalName, or use an Ingress resource to expose your services.

  Gk ───

Can i set that External-IP in the yaml?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can specify the external IP for a Service in the service's YAML definition. However, this is typically done for Services of type `LoadBalancer` or `ExternalName`.

For a `LoadBalancer` type Service, you can specify the `loadBalancerIP` field in the spec:

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 95.217.1.185
```

However, please note that this is a request for the cloud provider to provision a load balancer with this IP, and it's up to the cloud provider whether it supports this and whether the IP is available. If you're not using a cloud provider that supports this, or if the IP is not available, this setting might be ignored.

For a Service of type `ExternalName`, you can specify the `externalName` field in the spec:

```yaml
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.external.example.com
```

This creates a Service that acts as an alias for an external service, and DNS lookups for this Service will return CNAME records that point to the `externalName`.

If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in an environment that doesn't automatically assign external IPs to Services, such as a bare metal environment, you might want to consider other ways to expose your services, such as using an Ingress controller or a NodePort Service.

  Gk ───

```
# apply the file
kubectl apply -f mycaddy.yaml

This will create a service of type LoadBalancer in the caddy-system namespace on your cluster. You'll want to set any DNS records for accessing this cluster to the external IP address of this LoadBalancer when the external IP is provisioned by your cloud provider.

You can get the external IP address with kubectl get svc -n caddy-system
```


k get nodes -o wide tells me, that k8s knows that External-IP of bast is 95.217.1.185: `bast                              Ready    <none>                      4h27m   v1.30.2+k3s2   10.0.0.2      95.217.1.185     Ubuntu 24.04 LTS     6.8.0-38-generic     containerd://1.7.17-k3s1

I mean: Why is a service of type loadbalancer not caring about the node's ExternalIP ??

  Copilot ───

The `LoadBalancer` service type in Kubernetes is typically used in cloud environments where the cloud provider provisions an external load balancer to forward traffic to the service's pods. The external IP of the `LoadBalancer` service is the IP of this external load balancer, not the external IP of the node.

When you create a `LoadBalancer` service, Kubernetes creates a `NodePort` service and a `ClusterIP` service, and the cloud provider creates an external load balancer that forwards traffic to the `NodePort` service on the nodes. The external IP of the `LoadBalancer` service is the IP of the external load balancer, not the external IP of the nodes.

In non-cloud environments, or in cloud environments where the cloud provider does not support automatic creation of load balancers, the `LoadBalancer` service behaves like a `NodePort` service. The `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `LoadBalancer` service remains in the `<pending>` state because there is no external load balancer.

If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in an environment that doesn't automatically assign external IPs to `LoadBalancer` services, you might want to consider other ways to expose your services, such as using an Ingress controller or a `NodePort` service.

In your case, since you're running the Caddy ingress controller on a specific node and not using a cloud provider's load balancer, you should use the external IP of the node to access the Caddy ingress controller, not the external IP of the `LoadBalancer` service.

  Gk ───

Ok, so how would I do that?
The helm chart creates a service of type LoadBalancer, and I see that in the yaml created by helm template. Can't I use this then?

  Copilot ───

In a non-cloud environment, a Service of type `LoadBalancer` behaves like a `NodePort` service. It automatically creates a `NodePort` service, which exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). 

You can access the `NodePort` service from outside the cluster by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. In your case, `<NodeIP>` would be the external IP of your `bastion` node.

To find the `NodePort` assigned to your service, you can describe the service wityyh `kubectl describe service <service-name>`. Look for the `NodePort` field in the output.

However, if you specifically want to use the `LoadBalancer` type and get an external IP assigned to your service, you would need a LoadBalancer implementation that supports bare metal environments. 

One such implementation is MetalLB. MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols. It allows you to create Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer` in clusters that don't run on a cloud provider with built-in load balancer support.

If you decide to use MetalLB, you would install it to your cluster, and then it would assign external IPs to `LoadBalancer` services from a range you specify.

The error message in the events of the service indicates that the Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) is trying to create a load balancer but is unable to do so because neither the `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location` nor the `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/network-zone` annotation is set on the service.

When you create a `LoadBalancer` type service in a Kubernetes cluster running on Hetzner Cloud, the Hetzner CCM automatically creates a Hetzner Cloud Load Balancer to expose the service. The CCM uses the `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location` and `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/network-zone` annotations on the service to determine where to create the load balancer.

If you want to use a Hetzner Cloud Load Balancer to expose your service, you should add one of these annotations to your service definition:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location: fsn1
```

Replace `fsn1` with the location where you want to create the load balancer.

However, since you mentioned that you want to use the Caddy ingress controller on a specific node and not a Hetzner Cloud Load Balancer, you might want to change the type of your service to `NodePort` or `ClusterIP` instead of `LoadBalancer`. This will expose the service on the node where the Caddy ingress controller is running, and you can access the service at the node's IP address.

  Gk ───

No, I don't want the CCM to create an LB for me! I want this caddy LB on the bast node (which has a public IP) to act like a loadbalancer for traffic from the internet into my cluster.
You said this: To find the `NodePort` assigned to your service, you can describe the service wityyh `kubectl describe service <service-name>`. Look for the `NodePort` field in the output.
That's why I sent you this describe output. You see the NodePort there. How can I use that information to get traffic into my cluster, for port 80 on the external ip of that bast node?

  Copilot ───

I see, you want to use the `NodePort` service to expose your Caddy ingress controller to the internet using the public IP of your `bast` node.

A `NodePort` service is accessible on each node's IP at the specified port number. This port is open on every node and any traffic that is sent to this port on any node is forwarded to the service.

From your `kubectl describe service` output, the `NodePort` for the `http` port is `30435`. This means you can access the Caddy ingress controller's `http` port at `<bast-node-ip>:30435`.

However, you likely want to access your service on the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443). `NodePort` services are assigned a port in the range 30000-32767, so they can't be accessed on ports 80 and 443 directly.

To expose your service on ports 80 and 443, you have a few options:

1. **Use a reverse proxy**: You can set up a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy on your `bast` node to forward traffic from ports 80 and 443 to the `NodePort` of your service.

2. **Use iptables rules**: You can add iptables rules on your `bast` node to forward traffic from ports 80 and 443 to the `NodePort` of your service. Here's an example:

    ```bash
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 30435
    ```

    This command adds a rule that redirects all traffic coming to port 80 to port 30435.

3. **Use MetalLB**: If you're running your cluster on bare metal, you can use MetalLB as a load balancer. MetalLB can assign a `LoadBalancer` service a real IP address from a range you define, and it can expose services on any port, not just ports 30000-32767.

Please note that these methods involve directing traffic or making network configuration changes on your node, so you should be careful to understand the implications and ensure your node's network security is properly configured.

  Gk ───

I see. Ok, in deed, locally on bast I can access that 30435 port and get a HTTP Response.

But the iptables rule you gave me did not work, port 80 still not accessible from outside.  Could you give a caddyfile for a caddy server installed manually, which redirects all 80 to 30435?

  Copilot ───

Sure, you can use Caddy as a reverse proxy to redirect traffic from port 80 to port 30435. Here's a basic Caddyfile that does this:

```plaintext
:80 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:30435
}
```

This Caddyfile configures Caddy to listen on port 80 and reverse proxy all incoming requests to `localhost:30435`.

To use this Caddyfile, save it to a file (for example, `Caddyfile`), then start Caddy with this file:

```bash
caddy run --config Caddyfile
```

This command starts Caddy with the configuration specified in the `Caddyfile`.

Please note that you'll need to run Caddy as root or use a system service manager like systemd to allow it to bind to port 80, as this is a privileged port. Also, make sure that your firewall allows incoming connections on port 80.

  Gk ───

ok understood.

But a bit hefty, passing traffic through 2 caddy servers until the actual aplication sees it.

Lets try metallb. You said: "3. **Use MetalLB**: If you're running your cluster on bare metal, you can use MetalLB as a load balancer. MetalLB can assign a `LoadBalancer` service a real IP address from a range you define, and it can expose services on any port, not just ports 30000-32767.
"

Well, I do **NOT** run my cluster on bare metal, but on cloud servers from an infra provider. I just do not want to use THEIR loadbalancer, but do it all on my bast node. This is not bare metal but it's my server with a static public IP. Is MetalLB then also the solution for my problem?

  Copilot ───

Yes, MetalLB can still be a solution for your use case. Even though MetalLB is often associated with bare metal clusters, it can be used in any environment where you have control over a range of IP addresses that can be routed to your nodes, including on cloud servers.

MetalLB provides a network load balancer implementation for Kubernetes using standard routing protocols, and it allows you to create `LoadBalancer` type services in environments that don't have a built-in load balancer available.

In your case, you can configure MetalLB with a range of IP addresses that includes the public IP of your `bast` node. When you create a `LoadBalancer` service, MetalLB will assign it an IP from this range and handle the routing of traffic to your service.

Here are the general steps to install and configure MetalLB:

1. **Install MetalLB** on your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.11.0/manifests/namespace.yaml
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.11.0/manifests/metallb.yaml
    ```

2. **Create a secret** for the MetalLB speaker:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"
    ```

3. **Configure MetalLB** with a ConfigMap:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      namespace: metallb-system
      name: config
    data:
      config: |
        address-pools:
        - name: default
          protocol: layer2
          addresses:
          - 95.217.1.185/32
    ```

    Replace `95.217.1.185/32` with the public IP of your `bast` node. This ConfigMap configures MetalLB to use Layer 2 mode and assigns it a single IP address, which is the public IP of your `bast` node.

4. **Apply the ConfigMap**:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
    ```

After these steps, you should be able to create `LoadBalancer` services that are exposed on the public IP of your `bast` node.

You mean then my caddy ingress I created previously ,which listens on Node Port might then also work?

  Copilot ───

Yes, after setting up MetalLB, your existing `LoadBalancer` type services, including your Caddy ingress controller, should automatically get an external IP assigned by MetalLB. This will be one of the IPs from the range you specified in the MetalLB configuration.

In your case, since you've specified a single IP (the public IP of your `bast` node) in the MetalLB configuration, that's the IP that will be assigned to your `LoadBalancer` services.

Once MetalLB is set up and the external IP is assigned, you should be able to access your Caddy ingress controller on the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443) using the public IP of your `bast` node.

You can check the external IP assigned to your service by running:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n caddy-system
```

The `EXTERNAL-IP` column should show the external IP assigned to your service.

  Copilot ───

The error message indicates that the `PodSecurityPolicy` resource is not available. This resource was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21 and removed in 1.25.

As of version 0.11.0, MetalLB's manifests still include `PodSecurityPolicy` resources, which is why you're seeing this error.

To work around this issue, you can install MetalLB without the `PodSecurityPolicy` resources. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the MetalLB manifests:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.11.0/manifests/metallb.yaml -o metallb.yaml
    ```

2. Remove the `PodSecurityPolicy` resources from the manifests:

    ```bash
    sed -i '/kind: PodSecurityPolicy/,+15d' metallb.yaml
    ```

3. Apply the modified manifests:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f metallb.yaml
    ```

This will install MetalLB without the `PodSecurityPolicy` resources.

After installing MetalLB, you can proceed with the rest of the setup (creating the secret and the ConfigMap).

Now that I have my metallb on bast and it forwards to caddy ingress - does this mean I can remove the node selector for caddy, which forced it to live on bast?

  Copilot ───

Yes, you can remove the node selector from your Caddy ingress controller's configuration. 

With MetalLB set up, the `LoadBalancer` service type will work as expected, and Kubernetes will be able to route traffic to the appropriate pods regardless of the node they're running on. 

This means you can allow Kubernetes to schedule the Caddy ingress controller pods on any node based on its scheduling algorithm, which takes into account factors like resource availability and taints/tolerations.

However, keep in mind that if you remove the node selector, Kubernetes may schedule the Caddy ingress controller pods on any node, not just the `bast` node. If you have any node-specific configurations or if you want to keep the Caddy ingress controller on the `bast` node for other reasons, you might want to keep the node selector.
