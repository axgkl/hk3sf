### Topo: 3 Masters for k8s HA. No API LBs

Why: 

1. don't want to ever have to recover a broken k8s. So: 3.
2. => Workloads on (cheap) masters - but with **autoscaled** add/delete workers if required.

IPs: Priv IPs are for free -> Only 1 pub IP (on a bastion outside the k8s cluster, which runs trivially restorable services w/o k8s). Also more secure, only this to shield.

## Play Time

If new to this world, check these:

- [ingress](./k8s_ingress.md)
- [autoscaling](./k8s_autoscaler.md)
- [csi](./k8s_csi.md)


Now check [here](./metal.md) regarding some pretty heavy metal stuff.  It's about how we wiped the need for a hetzner loadbalancer for services...

Edit: And it was in vain, see first paragraph there.

Now of the real solution regarding networking:
